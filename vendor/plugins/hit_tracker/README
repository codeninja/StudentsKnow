HitTracker
==========

HitTracker allows you to use your DB to track access to various hits to your models.
WARNING!  This can exponentially increase your db hits.  Not recommended for heavily
trafficked sites

Migration
==========
class CreateHits < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :hits do |t|
      t.column :hittable_type, :string
      t.column :hittable_id, :integer
      t.column :kind, :string
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :hits
  end
end

Usage
==========

Add the following to the model you want to track:

class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
	track_hits
end


In your controller, when you decide to create a hit on the model, do this:

hit(@object, 'PageView') # where 'PageView' can be any string you want to use to 
												 # distinguish the hit

# This works for a collection of items too!
hit(@collection, 'SearchResult')
